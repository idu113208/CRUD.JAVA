## 2024-05-23 - Login/Register Accessibility & Navigation
**Learning:** Adding explicit `for`/`id` associations and `autocomplete` attributes to authentication forms is a high-impact, low-effort accessibility win. Users often get stuck without direct navigation links between Login and Register pages.
**Action:** Always check authentication forms for: 1. Label associations, 2. Autocomplete attributes, 3. Cross-navigation links.
