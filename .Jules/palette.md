## 2024-05-23 - Modernizing Legacy PHP Views
**Learning:** Bootstrap 5 Floating Labels are an excellent "drop-in" modernization for legacy PHP views. They solve accessibility issues (missing labels) and add interaction delight (animations) without requiring any changes to the underlying PHP logic or backend structure.
**Action:** When encountering legacy forms with placeholders as labels, prefer refactoring to Floating Labels over adding static labels, as it preserves the compact layout while significantly improving UX.
