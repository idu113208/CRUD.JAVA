## 2024-05-23 - Login/Register Accessibility & Flow
**Learning:** Adding explicit `for`/`id` associations and `autocomplete` attributes to authentication forms is a low-effort, high-impact accessibility win. Users often switch between login and register, so direct links between them reduce friction significantly.
**Action:** Always check form inputs for label association and autocomplete support. Ensure auth pages have cross-linking navigation.
