## 2024-10-25 - Authentication Forms Accessibility
**Learning:** Legacy PHP applications often neglect semantic HTML in forms, missing `for`/`id` associations which breaks screen reader accessibility and click-to-focus behavior.
**Action:** Always audit form inputs for `id` and `for` attributes, and add standard `autocomplete` attributes to improve user convenience and password manager integration.
