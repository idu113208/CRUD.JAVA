## 2024-03-24 - Accessibility and Navigation in Auth Forms
**Learning:** Legacy PHP forms often lack basic accessibility features like label-input association and autocomplete attributes, which significantly impacts screen reader users and password manager usability.
**Action:** When working on legacy auth forms, always verify `for`/`id` pairs and `autocomplete` attributes, and ensure explicit cross-navigation links exist.
